# SpamIDBot
this bot will help you to get IDs of users from the join actions from the Telegrams Admin Log

You will need Telethon. Install it via:

```
apt-get install telethon
```

You also need your own App_id etc., this is explained in a lot of docs.

Maybe have a look at that:
https://telethon.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extra/basic/creating-a-client.html

this was a very short project idea, I don't care about anything. It should work.
